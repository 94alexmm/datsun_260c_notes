Also known as the H230 or H330 Cedric.

Jatco L3N71B or 4 Spd manual 71B

## Brake master cylinder
Use Datsun 260Z 22.22mm Tokico (It is identical)

## Front brake pads
Use Datsun 260Z. Uses same Sumitomo calipers. Can be upgraded to same hilux 4 pots. Unsure of disc to use at this time. See Z forums

Fits H230. Unsure if this is the same as H330

## Wheels
Stud pattern 5x114.3

## Steering

2x TE432R tie rod ends
2x TE546L tie rod ends 

### Idler arm
2 Types:

#### SX4221

Early H230 uses SX4221. This is the same as a D21 navara so is still easy to obtain.

#### SX260C

Late H230 and H330 use SX260C which appears to no longer be available based on FB posts. this mounts to the chassis rail using 2x M10x1.25x80mm bolts.


## Rear wheel cylinder
Appears to change over the years
See https://www.autofrenseinsa.com/sites/default/files/catalogos/brake-catalogue-2019-autofren.pdf

Late 260Z wheel cylinders fit. the bore does not match though. originally 3/4. Z car is 7/8. brake hose and bleeder are on opposite sides.



## Rear boot seal
Holden captiva boot seal fits perfect length wise but is the wrong extrusion. Cut inner part of seal to allow latch to fit

## Front suspension lowering
Use HQ Holden front coil springs
V8 Springs standard height will raise it around 10mm
Can cut factory V8 springs or alternatively buy 6cyl springs or lowered V8 springs

## Rear lowering
Use an AU Falcon block kit
The U bolts fit as-is
The block needs to be bored out slightly in order to seat on spring. Top ideally needs a bush to make larger.
